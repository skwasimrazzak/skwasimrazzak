Currently, I work as an Android Developer, constantly seeking new learning opportunities and refusing to confine myself to just one tech stack. I thoroughly enjoy coding and have uploaded several basic websites and apps to track my progress as I continue to learn and develop. While my expertise lies primarily in Android development, I also possess a rudimentary understanding of Java and C++ programming languages.

I am highly enthusiastic about collaboration, often creating teams of like-minded individuals to work together on projects. This collaborative approach is something I frequently engage in and thoroughly enjoy. My insatiable thirst for learning has been the driving force behind my journey so far, motivating me to continually push myself and explore new horizons.
