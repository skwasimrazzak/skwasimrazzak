Currently, I am an Android Developer. I keep on learning and I dont let my knowledge to be bound to any one tech stack. Love coding and uploaded some basic websites and Apps to track my improvement through out the process of learning and developing. I have a rudimentary understanding of Java and C++ programming. Very enthusiastic about collaboration. Creating a team of like-minded people and working with them to build project is something I often do and like to do so. Having a constant urge to learn made me do whatever I did to date.
